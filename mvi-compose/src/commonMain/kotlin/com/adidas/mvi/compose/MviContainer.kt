/**
 * The [MviContainer] is a composable function for implementing the MVI in Jetpack Compose, providing a convenient way to observe the state of your ViewModel.
 * The MVIContainer should be used in non-screen composable with a ViewModel attached, such as a ViewPager page that will be
 * included inside of a parent screen.
 * @param state The current state of the MVI ViewModel. This parameter must be of type [StateFlow]<[State]<TViewState, TSideEffect>>, where TViewState is the type
 * of the view state and TSideEffect is the type of the side effect.
 * @param onSideEffect A lambda function that is called when a side effect is emitted by the MVI ViewModel. The TSideEffect parameter of the function is
 * the emitted side effect.
 * @param onViewState A composable function that takes the current view state as its parameter and composes the UI for the container.
