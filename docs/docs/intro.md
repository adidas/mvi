# Introduction

**adidas MVI** is a lightweight library that helps developers implement the **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** architectural pattern in Android and JVM applications.

The key advantages of using the MVI pattern include:

- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Clear flow of data within your app.
- **Immutable Data:** Reduces the likelihood of bugs and makes the codebase more reliable.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Model, View, and Intent are strictly separated, simplifying maintenance and testing.

Initially developed for the **adidas CONFIRMED** app, the library has since been open-sourced to simplify MVI implementation across different projects.

## Features

- **Lightweight:** Minimal setup with clear APIs.
- **Built-in Thread Safety:** Ensures concurrent state management without data races.
- **Customizable:** Provides utilities and tools that adapt to different app needs.
